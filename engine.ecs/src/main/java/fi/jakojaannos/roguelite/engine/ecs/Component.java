/**
 * Tag-interface for defining regular components. Components are data, that's really about it. Only
 * getters are allowed. Few exceptions to this rule won't be the end of the world, but in general,
 * one should avoid putting any logic to components. In other words: Mutating data is Systems'
 * responsibility, components are just for storing the data.
 * <p>
 * Components are stored in bulk blocks of memory. (Well I just lied, not just yet. It's planned,
 * but implementation is not quite there yet), meaning that components should be as compact as
 * possible. Storing arrays or any variable sized data-types in components should be avoided, and
 * might be prohibited in near future.
