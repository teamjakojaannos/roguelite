 * Everything in the game {@link World world} is an entity in some way. Enemies are entities. The
 * Player is an entity. As of writing this, the level geometry is one huge complex entity. That
 * being said, as stated above, entities themselves are simple. They are just an ID for a collection
 * of components.
 * <p>
 * To achieve complex behavior, or actually any behavior at all, interaction with {@link Component
 * components} and {@link ECSSystem Systems} are required. <code>ECSSystem</code>s are logical units
 * which manipulate <code>Component</code>s, iterating based on entities' component combinations.
 * <code>Component</code>s on the other hand, are just plain data.
 * <p>
 * Entities cannot be manipulated directly. All interactions, including adding/getting/removing
 * components are to be done through the {@link EntityManager} used to create the entity.
